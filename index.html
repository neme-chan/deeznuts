            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>
                This is a personal blogpost merged with a fanmade game I am developing called "Noway's Ecstacy.
                With funny moments, inspired by Class of '09. I might include references here, with all the 
                moments where noway is an absolute L. I will continue this project faster if I have a budget, 
                and people who would do art designs to contribute in this project. 
            </p>
            <h1>Target Audience</h1>
            <p>
                This game is playable for 15/yo and above. It is highly advisable for you to note that some 
                scenes will have a bit of sex jokes as the purpose of this game is to highlight the personality 
                of noway and his antics. Do NOT interact with this at all if you are uncomfortable with the genre 
                of the game.
            </p>
